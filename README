NAME

Finance::Bank::ABSA - Check your ABSA bank accounts from Perl

SYNOPSIS

  use Finance::Bank::ABSA;
  my @ABSAaccounts = Finance::Bank::ABSA->check_ABSA_balance(
      bankingid  => "xxxxxxxxx",
      mypassword => "xxxxxxx",
      seccode    => "xxxxxx"
  );

  foreach (@ABSAaccounts) {
      printf "  %-21s : %-18s : ZAR %12.2f : ZAR %12.2f\n",
        $_->{name}, $_->{account}, $_->{balance}, $_->{available};
  }

DESCRIPTION

This module provides a rudimentary interface to the South African
ABSA online banking system at https://vs1.absa.co.za/ibs/UserAuthentication.do
which is where http://www.absadirect.co.za redirects to.

DEPENDENCIES

You will need either Crypt::SSLeay or IO::Socket::SSL installed
for HTTPS support to work with LWP.  This module also depends on
WWW::Mechanize and HTML::TokeParser for screen-scraping.

CLASS METHODS

    check_ABSA_balance(bankingid => $u, mypassword => $p, seccode => $s)

Return an array of account hashes, one for each of your bank accounts.

ACCOUNT HASH KEYS

    $ac->name
    $ac->account
    $ac->balance
    $ac->available

Returns the account name, account number, real balance and available
balance which includes overdraft/creditlines.

WARNING

This warning is from Simon Cozens' Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB, and seems
just as apt here.

This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and
that means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit
the source of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not
doing anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful
to me, but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

THANKS

Chris Ball for Finance::Bank::HSBC, upon which a lot of this code is
based. Also to Simon Cozens for Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB, upon which
most of Finance::Bank::HSBC is based, Andy Lester (and Skud, by continuation)
for WWW::Mechanize, Gisle Aas for HTML::TokeParser.
